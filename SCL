/*!
 * @mainpage Storage Class Library (SCL).
 * @section Introduction
 * The Storage Class Library implements a number of classes that have been developed as storage classes.<br>
 * The library is written in C++20.<br>
 * The library is written as an operating system independent library.<br>
 *
 * @section Containers
 * A number of STL-like containers are provided. Some of these are extensions to the STL offering tailored features that are not
 * available in the STL.
 *
 *                      123456789   123456789   123456789
 * Container Name     | Insertion |  Removal  |  Search   | Comments
 * ------------------ | :-------: | :------:  | :-------: |
 * vector             | 1         | O(n)      | O(n)      | STL container
 * map                | O(log n)  | O(log n)  | O(log n)  | STL container
 * mapAsVector        | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(log N)  | Fast traversal.
 * set                | O(log n)  | O(log n)  | O(log n)  | STL container
 * vector_sorted      | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(log n)  | Efficient storage, fast transversal.
 * multiVector_sorted | O(n)      | O(n)      | O(log n)  | Fast traversal
 * bimap              | O(log n)  |           | O(log n)  | Bi-directional connection. Two keys.
 *
 *
 * @section Dependencies
 * The following open source libraries are required by the Storage Class library.
 * @arg Boost Library <a href="http//www.boost.org">Boost C++ Libraries</a>
 * @arg GCL <a href="http://https://github.com/gavin-blakeman/GCL">General Class Library</a>
 * @arg MCL <a href="http://https://github.com/gavin-blakeman/MCL">Math Class Library</a>
 *
 * @section Compilation Control
 * The following macros control how the code will be compiled for various applications.
 * @li @b SCL_NOMT - Do not use multi-threading. This should only be used on platforms where multi-threading is not available. By
 *									 default, multi-threading support is enabled. If multi-threading is available, the library will use all
 *                   available processors (1 thread = 1 processor) to perform multi-threaded concurrent operations.
 *
 * @section Projects
 * The Storage Class Library is used as the Astronomy Library by the following projects.
 * @li Astronomical Image Reduction and Data Analysis Software.  (<a href="http://www.astroManager.net">astroManager</a>)

 *
 * @section Development
 * The library is still under active development and is being expanded and improved.
 * @par Note
 * The classes within this library have been in development from 2005. As a result, all the code is not written using the
 * C++20 functionality. There is an opportunity to "clean" up the code by updating the code to reflect the C++20 standard.
 * All new code that is being developed is written to the C++20 standard.<br>
 * Any C string functions will be phased out over time. Any new code should not include C string functions, but should rather use
 * the C++ std::string classes.
 * @par Reporting Bugs
 *
 * @par Source Code
 *
